-- This is my first solo project. I'm geeking out about it and really quite proud that it works. --
-- All data taken from International Education's 'country_summary' public database. I used BigQuery for all SQL queries. --

-- First query the IE database for primary teachers --

SELECT indicator_name, value as primary_teachers, year, country_name, 
FROM `dark-mark-354801.international_education.international_education` 
WHERE country_name = 'United States' and 
  indicator_name = 'Teachers in primary education, both sexes (number)'
ORDER by year ASC

-- Then get secondary teachers -- 

SELECT indicator_name, value as secondary_teachers, year, country_name, 
FROM `dark-mark-354801.international_education.international_education` 
where country_name = 'United States' and 
  indicator_name = 'Teachers in secondary education, both sexes (number)'
  ORDER by year ASC
 
-- And finally, the total population of the United States --

SELECT indicator_name, value as population, year, country_name, 
FROM `dark-mark-354801.international_education.international_education` 
WHERE country_name = 'United States' AND 
  indicator_name = 'Population, total'
  ORDER BY year ASC
  
-- The three tables were saved locally as 'primary_teachers', 'secondary_teachers', and 'population' respectively. I'm sure I could have gotten all three in one go, I'll check into that later. -- 

-- Query to calculate the percent of teachers relative to total population --

SELECT
  secondary_teachers.num_teachers + primary_teachers.num_teachers as total_teachers, 
  population.population,
  (secondary_teachers.num_teachers + primary_teachers.num_teachers) * 100 / population.population as percent_teachers,
  primary_teachers.year
FROM US_Teachers.secondary_teachers
JOIN 
US_Teachers.primary_teachers
ON secondary_teachers.year = primary_teachers.year
JOIN
US_Teachers.population
ON secondary_teachers.year = population.year

-- Next potential indicator_name queries: 
  'Total net enrolment rate, primary, both sexes (%)'
  'Out-of-school children of primary school age, both sexes (number)'
